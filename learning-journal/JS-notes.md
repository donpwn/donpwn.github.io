# JavaScript
## What is the difference?
HTML is where the content lives, which gives the page structure and adds semantics. CSS enhances the HTML page as a presentation layer which is how the content is presented. JavaScript is how the page behaves with interactivity.
JavaScript increases the user experience with the site.
