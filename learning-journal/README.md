# Who Am I?

My name is Phong Vu Doan and I am a he. I met my wife while in college and joined the Army as a medic which would help me get into *medical school*. I was in the military for about nine years, having the opportunity to work with fantastic teams throughout the country and also out of states. During my time in Washington, I revigorated my passion for developing as I have done so while in high school using **Basic** and **C++**. I joined [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org) and volunteered my time to learn as much as I can and as fast as I can. I decided then that that was the path I would choose.

# Growth Mindset

What does ***growth mindset*** mean to me? Itâ€™s the want, the determination, the drive, and the motivation in which an individual continuously learns. **Learning** is the keyword because as new technology or even break through knowledge emerges, one must be able to learn it to keep up with the needs and demands of consumers. There are a lot of people who are content with themselves, but individuals who strive to be better each day will improve the organization. I used to tell my subordinates that every day one must improve themselves and the organization by at least ten percent because there is always something to do and something to learn.

To keep myself in a growth mindset, I will remind myself

- That I am not perfect and can always improve.
- To view obstacles as an opportunity to learn.
- I need to grow with the team.
